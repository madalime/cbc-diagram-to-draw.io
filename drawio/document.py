"""Builds the mxGraph XML of a ``.drawio`` file from a parsed diagram.

One box per statement holding its annotated guarded command -- precondition,
command and postcondition on a line each -- and one edge per
refinement carrying the step's title -- ``S<sub>1</sub>: COMPOSITION`` -- as an
edge label beside the arrow.  Each box wears its step number in a small circle
in its top left corner.  Beside the root stand the diagram's two
declaration boxes, its variables and its global conditions.  All of them come
from :mod:`rendering.gcl_style`, whose HTML is exactly what draw.io expects in
a ``html=1`` cell.

#: it lays the label out: a box that is resized, retyped or re-wrapped by hand
#: keeps the indent, and it follows the text if the wrap point moves.
#:
#: CSS cannot ask whether the text wrapped at all, so a triple short enough for
#: one line is indented too.  Deciding that here instead would mean guessing the
#: wrap point at generation time, and the guess would go stale the moment the
#: box is touched in draw.io.
BADGE_INDENT = BADGE_INSET + BADGE_SIZE + BADGE_INSET - PADDING

#: What separates the triple's three parts inside a box.  A line break written
#: into the label itself, so the precondition, the command and the postcondition
#: always start their own line -- rather than running on and breaking wherever
#: the box happens to end.  Wrapping stays on: a part too long for the box still
#: wraps, only within its own line.
