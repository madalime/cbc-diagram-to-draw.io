"""``gcl`` style -- one annotated guarded command per statement, as HTML.

Each statement of the diagram becomes a numbered refinement step::

    S<sub>4</sub>: STATEMENT
        {A.length &gt; 0} i := 0; {A.length &gt; 0 ∧ i == 0}

The step is titled with the placeholder it refines: the body of a statement
names its children as ``S<sub>n</sub>``, and the step spelling that child out
carries the same label.  The root refines nothing and is simply ``S``.

Numbers are handed out level by level -- left to right, top to bottom -- so a
statement is always numbered before the statements it refines into.  Conditions
carry the mathematical symbols -- ``&&``, ``||``, ``\\forall`` and ``\\exists``
are written ``∧``, ``∨``, ``∀`` and ``∃``, the comparisons ``<=``, ``>=``,
``!=`` and ``==`` are written ``≤``, ``≥``, ``≠`` and ``=``, and an implication
``->`` or ``==>`` is written ``→`` or ``⇒``.  All text is HTML-escaped, so the
output can be dropped into an HTML context as is.
